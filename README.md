## About Ludwig the Pig
This is my personal website. The goal of this site/repo is to build as many custom features in React without using libraries, such as bootstrap, and make cool stuff with other libraries, such as d3.js.

The site is being hosted on AWS.


## Current Custom Features
- Fixed navbar that updates the active link as you scroll.
- Conditionally rendered tabs.
- Conditionally applied classes.
- CSS Grid for portfolio section

## Future Plans
-Implement a full stack app with Node and Express, etc. etc.
